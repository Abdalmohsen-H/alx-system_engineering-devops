# Task0: bash script to get info about specific passed domain, that have known some subdomains
# this task is demo how to use bash function, dig, awk, how to create subdomain (on website dashboard via A record)
# and how to change logic based of numbers of passed arguments, always use "" around argument like "$1" not $1
# to use a bash variable inside awk use -v option
# /IN/ is a patttern to get lines that have records (i.e. ignore first line , also could use tail -2 as output of this dig, grep is only 2 lines

}
if [ "$#" == 2 ]  # usage ./filename domain subdomain
then

elif [ "$#" == 1 ]  # usage ./filename domain
